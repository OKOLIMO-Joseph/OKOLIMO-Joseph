#Main Problem: Low Market for farm produce
#Sub-problems: Low quality harvest, poor transport and storage facilities.

#Causes of each sub-problem:
#Low quality harvest:Infertility of thr soil, Poor handling of farm produce like milk
#Poor transport facilities: Poor roads, Inaccessibility to sophisticated transport vans, 
#Poor storage facilities: Inaccessibility to sophisticated storage equipments like fridges,
